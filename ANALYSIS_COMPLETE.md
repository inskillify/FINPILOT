## 📞 Quick Win Option

If you want to see the value of agentic AI without full system refactor:

### Implement TransactionAgent (2-4 weeks)
- NLP-based category detection
- Anomaly detection
- Pattern matching
- Recommendations

This would demonstrate the value of agentic AI and provide immediate user benefit.
